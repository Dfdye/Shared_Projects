This rack is designed for my personal tool set, but should be adaptable to a variety of uses. I've included links to the tools that I use or close equivalents that should fit (many of my tools have been discontinued).  Some of the tool slots don't have handle cups included by default.  If you want cups to help support the bottom of those handles, you can copy and paste the cup shapes in CAD software.  I print the cups and the main body plate separately for no other reason than that's how I chose to do it, but you can obviously print as once piece.  I've printed my version of this in ABS, but if you do this, know that it WILL warp unless your printer is tuned VERY well and you keep chamber temperatures hot.  I would not try and print this on a glass plate since removing it may be a huge ordeal.  Use a removable flexy bed.  It's 2022--if you aren't already using one, it's time to upgrade!  

I have intentionally not included STL files so that you have to at least open the STEP file in a CAD program to customize tool hole sizes for your particular tool set.
