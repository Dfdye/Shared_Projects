These shelves were designed to fit the parts bins that I have accumulated over the last several years, 
but are hopefully in sizes that can accommodate other parts bins as well.  The large shelves are 
designed to fit on a 350 mm build plate, and do leave about 20mm of the bins hanging out of the front 
for the One Slot Tall and Short shelves. This is a design accommodation to allow for the parts to be 
printed as a single piece on my largest printer rather than having to join multipe pieces together. 
The overhang does not affect functionality of the shelves, but it does make the front of the large bins
stick out slightly further than the smaller bins.  Screw holes and heat set inserts have been placed in 
the sides of the racks to allow them to be joined, but I have not found this to be necessary--I just 
never took those holes out.  The top brace is more of a finishing trim piece than a functional part, 
but it does help if you want to stack something on top of the racks.
